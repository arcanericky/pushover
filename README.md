## About

This package enables your Go application to send requests to the [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) service through the [Pushover REST API](https://pushover.net/api). Implementing a notification message in your Go code is as simple as `pushover.Message(pushover.MessageRequest{User: "user", Token: "token", Message: "message"})`. It's just a straightforward function call - no fancy methods attached to functions, just populate a structure and [Go](https://golang.org/).

Note that Pushover has many APIs available, but currently this package only supports:
-  [Messages](https://pushover.net/api#messages)
-  [User/Group Validation](https://pushover.net/api#validate)

The Pushover service is a great way to send notifications to your device for any purpose. The device application is [free for 7 days](https://pushover.net/faq#overview-fees), after which you must purchase it for a one-time price of $4.99 per platform. It comes with a [7,500 message per month limit](https://pushover.net/faq#overview-limits) with the [ability to pay for more messages](https://pushover.net/faq#overview-usage).


## Using the Package

Obtaining a Pushover account and adding an application for using this library are not covered in this README. Pushover API and user tokens are required.

To use this Pushover package (with Go 1.13+), just import it and make a single call to `pushover.Message`.

```
$ cat > main.go << EOF
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "github.com/arcanericky/pushover"
)

func main() {
  var r *pushover.MessageResponse
  var e error

  if r, e = pushover.Message(pushover.MessageRequest{Token: os.Args[1], User: os.Args[2], Message: os.Args[3]}); e != nil {
    fmt.Println(e)
    return
  }
  fmt.Println(r)
}
EOF
$ go mod init demo
$ go build
$ ./demo api-token user-token "Test Message"
```

## Using the Utility

A simple application to demonstrate and test the Pushover package is included with this repository in [Released executables](https://github.com/arcanericky/pushover/releases) and is useful on its own. While using Pushover via [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) is simple enough, this utility makes it even easier.

```
$ pushover message --token token --user user --message message
```

For help, use the `--help` option.

```
$ pushover --help
Pushover CLI version 1.0.0

Submit various requests to the Pushover API. Currently only
message (notification) and validate are supported.

See the README at https://github.com/arcanericky/pushover for

## Inspiration

During my development workday I often find I need to monitor state of systems, programs, networks, etc. Eventually I concluded the Pushover service was best for me and I've been using it in some monitoring scripts using `curl`. One day I found a need to do this in one of my Go utilities and that's when this code was started.
